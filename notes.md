          and what we have to accomplish
          
27/02/21: We disgussed about Feedback #2 and based on that we decided that: 
          1) Christos will modify cookies so that when a user exits the game, the session's current question is saved
             and can be recovered when the user enters the game 
          2) Namu will add a loader element to indicate that the question is being loaded at the start of the game
          3) Marina will work on adding an alert dialog when a name is already in use and 
             will add an error message when future games are not available. 
             
03/03/21: In general, we disgussed about further improvements in our project: 
          1) Christos will continue working on cookie function so that the session progress is saved and 
             will also work on the location function so it updates the location 
             before answering a question for location-sensitive question
          2) Namu will add an instructions section, that includes info about how to play the game, in the index.html (homepage). 
             Will add the loader element to questions html page and will make css changes in app html
            (remove some boxes and borders around treasure hunt list).
          4) Marina will fix some css issues regarding the qr code (camera frame) and css changes on scoreboard,
             question index and current score elements in question html page (make them not clickable).
             Will also add description/role on index page
             
 06/03/21: Christos and Marina participated in this meeting to discuss about unit testing.
           For the purposes of this assignment, we decided to test the following functions: 
           getTreasureHunts (list), getScore (score) and getLeaderboard (leaderboard)
           We also had a brief discussion on user acceptance testing
           
 10/03/21: In this meeting we discussed more about User Acceptance Test (UAT), Nielsen’s heuristics and feedback #4.
          At this point, we decided Namu will have the role of the client for UAT. 
          In the test.html we will describe how we designed our product in a way that Nielsen's heuristic rules are satisfied.  
          For the time being, Namu will do a research on UAT, Christos will work on scoreboard (add a 'try again' button, 
          add 'refresh' button, create a new table that contains user's current score and ranking) 
          and Marina will work on unit testing (score, scoreboard) and will update css on scoreboard.
          
 17/03/21: Christos and Marina participated in this meeting to discuss elaborately on Nielsen’s heuristics and how these rules
          apply to the Treasure Hunt game. Furthermore, we discussed about what kind of tests we will provide the client (Namu) for the UAT. 
          Christos will work on cookies (remember the session) and Marina will work on unit testing (scoreboard). 
          
 23/03/21: In this meeting we did an overall assessment of the final product to check that everything works as expected.
          We also completed the tests for UAT and documented the test results in userAcceptance page
