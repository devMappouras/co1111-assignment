<h1 class="header">User Acceptance Plan</h1>
<div class="containerTesting">
    <p>
        User Acceptance Plan is a type of testing performed by the end user or the client to
        verify/accept the software system before moving the software application to the production environment.
        UAT is done in the final phase of testing after unit, integration and system testing is done.
        User Acceptance Testing is essential because developers might have built software based on
        requirements by their own understanding, so for testing whether the final product is accepted
        by client/end-user, user acceptance testing is needed.
